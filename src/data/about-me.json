    "imageName": "Portrait",
    "career": "Back in 2019, I wandered into a UI design workshop as a curious graphic designer and unexpectedly discovered my love for web development. Fast-forward to today, I’ve graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from Carleton University and now get to build exciting things full-time for the Max streaming app at Warner Bros. Discovery. Recently, I’ve been diving into web and full-stack projects, a few of which you can check out below or on my GitHub :)",
    "hobbies": "Beyond coding, I love exploring new cuisines, playing squash, and singing or writing songs with my guitar. I'm always open to swapping book recommendations, brainstorming project ideas, or just chatting about life, so let's connect!"
